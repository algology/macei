# Overview

MACY aims to automate much of the workflows that an idea validator executes today. The first use-case the MVP will focus on will be the early phase of an 11point2 engagement â€“ idea generation and validation using market signals. This will include the creation of an idea knowledge base (IKB) which will include mission attributes and content relevant for the mission scope. The IKB will be periodically updated based on signals from multiple sources.

# MVP Scope

The MVP will be a SaaS product that allows;

Users can login to a SaaS platform that will allow them to create new missions relevant for the client/problem being solved. These missions will store information in an unstructured form (i.e. not restricted to a particular format)
Users can create a knowledge base that can store mission scope, initial ideas, and an automated method for updating knowledge based on market signals.
Users can choose relevant market sources to update their knowledge base with periodically for example subscribe to latest industry reports, science journals or news topics.
Users can view the AI-enabled summary of relevant signals that have materially changed the viability of an idea (either positively or negatively)
